I forgot how to git already. Getting back into my blog project took some time and a lot of willpower. I used a few evenings figuring out a new way for backups. I have learned how to manage BTRFS subvolumes and set-up automatic snapshots of `/home` and `/mnt/dane`.

In the future I plan to move my server's partitions from XFS to BTRFS and take advantage of `send/receive`.
