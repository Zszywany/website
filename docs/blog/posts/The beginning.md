Today I have managed to set up a repository and started working with git.
I still have to wrap my head around branching. The next challenge will be putting this site on GitHub Pages. Later on I want to automate the deployment process in GitLab. Am I mad? Perhaps, but I will learn a lot. Or so I hope..
