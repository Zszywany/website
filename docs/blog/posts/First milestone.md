Today marks a small but important milestone. The site got published!

I have set up [repository mirroring](https://cylab.be/blog/431/publish-your-gitlab-project-to-github) and use GitHub Pages to serve it on my custom domain. I had to create the `CNAME` file inside my `docs_dir` for it to work, but it was all described in the documentation.

If for some reason GitHub goes down, the site is also published to GitLab Pages at `random-string.gitlab.io`. I can easily point my domain overe there if needed.
