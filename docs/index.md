Welcome to my personal blog/site/thing. It will evolve (or die), maybe house my homelab documentation later on.

Inspired by the [Level1Techs community](https://forum.level1techs.com/) I shall learn new things and share my experiences with the people around.

I would like to thank Wendell for his wholesomeness and for fostering a nice place to be on the vast dark internet.
