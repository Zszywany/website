#About me
## Who am I?
Professionally I am a Business Analyst with prior mechanical engineering experience in the automotive industry. My expertise are PLM and CRM solutions with more recent experience in developing web-apps for the public sector.

I like to dabble in new technologies and am cosplaying as a Sysadmin/DevOps person in my free time. I have a homelab and self-host some of the services my family uses on a daily basis, like Immich and Paperless-ngx.


## What do I plan to achieve here?
I am learning how to manage the whole pipeline from a written thought to a publicly accessible website. I previously thought that I want to become a DevOps Engineer and that transitioning to a Business Analyst role was just a stepping stone, a foot in the door.. 

I am not so sure anymore, but I am still toying with the idea. Changing professions is hard, but rewarding in the end. 

What will happen this time around? I honestly do not know, but I invite you to follow me on my journey.
